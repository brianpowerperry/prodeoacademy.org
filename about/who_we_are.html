                    Everything we do at Prodeo Academy, both in and out of the classroom, is based on our Five Core Values:
                    <br>
                    <b>Knowledge, Conscientiousness, Compassion, Integrity,</b>
                    and
                    <b>Respect.</b>
                </p>
