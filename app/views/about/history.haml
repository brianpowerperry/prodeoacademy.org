                %p
                    %b Prodeo Academy was founded in 2011.
                    Its founders, Rick Campion and Chancey Anderson recognized that in order for Prodeo Academy to be exceptionally successful, they needed to learn from the highest-performing schools in the country. Therefore, Rick Campion spent the past two years studying and completing internships in several such schools in order to bring best practices back to North Minneapolis. Chancey spent time teaching and writing curriculum for Uncommon Schools, one of the highest-performing networks in the country.

                    As experienced educators, they know that success in the classroom is a combination of many powerful factors and they designed a school to address each of those factors. Having worked at all levels of education, they were able to see what preparation for college looks like at every grade level. Their goal was to provide a place where
                    %i all families have the same platform for future success. 
                %p Prodeo Academy opens its doors in Fall 2013 with 3 kindergarten classrooms. The projected growth pattern is to add a new kindergarten class of 66 students each year until capacity is reached, with grades K-8.

                            %b Achievement gap:
                        The founders of Prodeo Academy are inspired to demonstrate that the achievement gap in Minneapolis does not have to be permanent. All children, no matter what their income level, should have have an education that enables them to truly succeed. Therefore, the founders created a school in North Minneapolis that expects results from its students, teachers and families.

                            %b Excellent teaching:
                        Knowing that high quality teaching is the most important factor in reducing the achievement gap, Prodeo Academy aims to hire only teachers with experience in the highest performing schools, teachers who clearly understand how to help kids reach their academic potential.
