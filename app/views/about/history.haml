                %p
                    Prodeo Academy was founded in 2011. Its founders, Rick Campion and Chancey Anderson, travelled across the country to study schools that were achieving exceptional results in order to bring back to Minnesota practices that have been proven successful. As experienced educators, they know that success in the classroom is a combination of many powerful factors and they designed a school to address each of those factors. Having worked at all levels of education, they were able to see what preparation for college looks like at every grade level. Their goal was to provide a place where

                        The founders of Prodeo Academy are inspired to demonstrate that the achievement gap in Minneapolis does not have to be permanent. Every child, no matter what his or her income level, should have an education that provides him or her to truly succeed. They created a school in North Minneapolis that expects results from its students, teachers and families.
