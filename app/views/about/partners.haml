                %p We are currently partnering with several preschools in order to help bridge the gap and provide our students with a smoother transition from preschool to kindergarten.
                %p We are also currently partnering with several universities who have provided resources, volunteers, and tutors.
                %p Furthermore, community resources have been an important connection.
                %p We look to continue to develop partnerships that help us support our students and families and close the gap.
