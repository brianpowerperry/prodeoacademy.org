        %p Kindergarten admission to Prodeo Academy is determined through a randomized lottery if the number of applicants exceeds the number of openings. A pre-determined number of spaces is determined each year based on the schoolâ€™s capacity.
        %p The admission process is conducted through a randomized selection protocol until all lottery selections have been confirmed, at which point a wait list is maintained. The wait list is then in effect for the duration of the school year.
        %p Once the wait list has been exhausted, open seats are filled on a first-come first-served basis.
