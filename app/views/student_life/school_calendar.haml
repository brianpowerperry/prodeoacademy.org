        %p Kindergarten admission to Prodeo Academy is determined through a randomized lottery if the number of applicants exceeds the number of openings. A pre-determined number of spaces will be determined each year based on the schoolâ€™s capacity.
        %p The admission process shall be conducted through a randomized selection protocol until all lottery selections have been confirmed, at which point a wait list shall be maintained. The wait list will be in effect for the duration of the school year.
        %p Once the wait list has been exhausted, open seats will be filled on a first-come first-served basis.
