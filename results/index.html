                        <p>We are excited about the tremendous growth our students continue to experience since starting with us. Last year we learned that scholars who transferred to us from other schools were making an average of .67 years of growth. Those same scholars made an average of 1.43 years of growth at Prodeo. They also show growth in living our PRIDE values.</p>

                        <p>The STEP Assessment was developed at the University of Chicago Urban Education Institute. It is used in high-performing schools across the country as a means to analyze student data and plan for instruction.</p>
