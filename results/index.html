                        <p>We are excited about the tremendous growth our students continue to experience since starting with us at the end of August. Fewer than 20% of our students were on grade level in September, and after just over two months at Prodeo Academy, 88% of our scholars were on grade level with 62% of those advanced. As of February, we are happy to report that 38% of our students have already passed an end of Kindergarten assessment and are now working on First Grade level material.</p>

                        <p>The STEP Assessment was developed at the University of Chicago Urban Education Institute. It is used in high-performing schools across the country as a means to analyze student data and plan for instruction.</p>
